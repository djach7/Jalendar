# Welcome!
Thank you for examining the Jalendar bot! This bot serves to track the Jalendar, also known as the Jon Calendar. The Jalendar is the new premier method of timekeeping, emphasising readability, simplicity, and accuracy.

# The Jalendar Explained
- Began on November 6, 1999 at 11:15am EST.
- Every year contains 1461 days.
- Every day contains 360 minutes.

- Every week contains 10 days.
- Days of the week are as follows: Jonsday, Jewsday, Jednesday, Jursday, Jiday, Jaturday, Jalday, Jarday, Jinday, Junday.
- While Jon is alive all dates are ended with IJ (Inside Jonny)
- Dates are commonly written as follows: `weekday, week/day/year minute:second IJ`
